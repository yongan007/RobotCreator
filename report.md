- I created 4 branch and then add filses and folder in each branch
- I modified readme.md each branch 
- I modified readme.md at master branch 
- I merge first branch with master branch and It was CONFLICT each other 
becuase each branch have different readme.md text so i check git status to see the changes and then commit it to master 
- For other branches before I merge them i just check the different by using "git diff <source_branch> <target_branch>"
- After I deleted the filse and folder that I added
