# FreeCAD RobotCreator Workbench
FreeCAD Workbench for URDF &amp; SDF and Gazebo

## Important Note 
THIS PROJECT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT (AKA it's not fully functional yet)

### What works?  
**Sdf export of links**  
* correctly scaled mesh exported as stl  
* inertia and collision geometry is based on stl  
  
**Joint export (in progress)**  
* can create joints objects and move them around in FreeCAD  
* can only be exported as a hinge joint arond x axis for the momemnt  
* GUI in progress
